In the process of continuous iteration, it is difficult to think through all the features that need to be supported at the beginning of development, and sometimes it is necessary to use the power of the community to continuously produce new feature points or optimize existing features. This requires the system to have a certain degree of scalability. The plug-in pattern is often the approach of choice, with the following advantages.

-   Single responsibility. Plug-in code is decoupled from the system code in engineering, can be developed independently, and the complexity of the internal logic of the framework isolated to developers.
-   Can be dynamically introduced and configured.

Plugin systems can be found in a wide range of popular software, such as Webpack, VSCode, and Chrome.

To make the rendering engine also well extensible, we also have a built-in plugin system that allows different renderers to extend their capabilities at runtime. The full set of currently supported plugins is listed below.

## Set of plug-ins

### CDN

[Import the core and renderer code](/en/guide/introduce#cdn) in UMD format first, then import plugin code in the same way.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@antv/g-plugin-rough-canvas-renderer@1.7.16/dist/index.umd.min.js"></script>
```

Then we can use plugin under the namespace `window.G`, take [g-plugin-rough-canvas-renderer](/en/plugins/rough-canvas-renderer) as an example:

```js
const plugin = new window.G.RoughCanvasRenderer.Plugin();
```

[Codesandbox Example](https://codesandbox.io/s/yi-umd-xing-shi-shi-yong-g-yi-ji-cha-jian-zsoln8?file=/index.js)

### NPM Module

[Install core and renderer from NPM](/en/guide/introduce#npm-module) first, then we can install plugins in the same way. Take [g-plugin-rough-canvas-renderer](/en/plugins/rough-canvas-renderer) as an example:

```bash
$ npm install @antv/g-plugin-rough-canvas-renderer --save
```

Then we can [registerPlugin](/en/api/renderer/renderer#registerplugin) on renderer:

```js
import { Plugin } from '@antv/g-plugin-rough-canvas-renderer';

renderer.registerPlugin(new Plugin());
```

## Relationship with Renderer

These [renderers](/en/api/renderer/renderer) essentially consist of a set of plug-ins through which their capabilities can also be extended.

```js
renderer.registerPlugin(new Plugin());
```
