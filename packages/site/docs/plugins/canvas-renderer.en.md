Provides Canvas2D-based rendering capabilities.

# Usage

The [g-canvas](/en/docs/api/renderer/canvas) renderer is built in by default, so there is no need to introduce it manually.

```js
import { Renderer as CanvasRenderer } from '@antv/g-canvas';
// Create a renderer with the plugin built in
const canvasRenderer = new CanvasRenderer();
```
