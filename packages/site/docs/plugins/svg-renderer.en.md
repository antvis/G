Provides SVG-based rendering capabilities.

# Usage

The [g-svg](/en/docs/api/renderer/svg) renderer is built in by default, so there is no need to introduce it manually.

```js
import { Renderer as SvgRenderer } from '@antv/g-svg';
// Create a renderer with the plugin built in
const svgRenderer = new SvgRenderer();
```
